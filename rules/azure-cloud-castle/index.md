# Game rules

Prerequisites:

 - A OWASP Cornucopia card deck. Both Website App Edition and Ecommerce Edition can be used.
 - A dice. Any dice will do.
 - A computer
 - A list of qr codes that takes the player to the page presenting the characters of the game.


Start the game by selecting a game master to lead the game if the game master hasn't been preselected. The game master will use the ["cheat sheet"](/cheatsheets/azure-cloud-castle) to keep track of where to lead the players.

The game master deals out all the OWASP Cornucopia cards. Once that is done let each player select a character associated with "The Azure Cloud Castle" game. The players choose their character by qr codes only, not knowing which character you will get is more fun and may make it more enjoyable to play the game again.

Once everyone has a character, present yourself. This way, everyone knows about your abilities, skills and spells.

The game master select "Azure Cloud Castle" from the games meny and start to read the plot of the game. 

After reading the plot, the players are presented with 1-4 choices.
They can "cast a spell", "use a weapon", "throw the dice" or "use a card".
All options are not always available. The players are not told which option is the best. The game master keep track on whether the choices the player make are valid or not.

Once you have played the game a couple of times, you can also play the game infront of an audience. If so, let the players dress up as their favorite character for the event.

## Rolling the dice

For simplicity you can use any type of dice. Say you use a dice with six edges (1-6). When the player throw the dice, if they get 1-3, then that would be a "low roll" and if they get 4-6, then that would be a "high roll". If you play with a dice with more edges just divide the possible edges that the dice can land on into low and high in a similar fashion. The game master can decide what a "high roll" and what a "low roll" is meant to be. Just make sure that you clarify this before starting the game.
