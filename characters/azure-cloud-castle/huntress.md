[Athena](https://github.com/MythicAgents/Athena) is an imfamous [huntress](https://www.huntress.com/) from [Mistica](https://github.com/IncideDigital/Mistica) a mythological island far out in the [Mythic](https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic) sea. She always carry a shield called [Aegis](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/products/aegis) that allowes the bearer to use a violent windstorm to force through unpenetrable barriers and walls using brute force. She also carry a large spear that she uses for [spear phishing](https://thecyberexpress.com/athena-agent-exploits-winrar-vulnerability/). Athena specializes in killing large sea monsters like the [Orca](https://orca.security/) which are sacred and worshiped by the Mythic people, but that Athena hates as they long ago killed her father while on a [phising](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) trip. She has therefor been banished from Mistica as she has slain many orcas without authorization from the Mythic tribal elders.
