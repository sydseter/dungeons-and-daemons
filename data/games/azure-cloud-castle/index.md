# The Azure Cloud Castle

The necromancer, [Sauron](https://medium.com/@Reveelium_AI/the-story-of-sauron-one-apt-to-rule-them-all-1f5c39674067), [the dark overloard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Overlord_(hacker_group)) of [Darkside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DarkSide_(hacker_group)) has kidnapped [Isa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security_awareness) [Dora](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/digital-operational-resilience-act-dora_en) the daughter of the dragon [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/), the three-headed dragon, and locked here away in a secure room in the highest tower of the [Azure Cloud Castle](https://romikoderbynew.com/2023/09/20/the-cloud-chronicles-caf-landing-zones-and-levels-unveiled/).

[Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/), which have threatened to destroy the world if he doesn't get his daughter back, has put the gods at high alert as they fear a pending war between gods and dragons. [Zeus](https://github.com/DenizParlak/Zeus) and the god of war, [Ares](https://github.com/sweetsoftware/Ares), has promised a hefty award to anyone that can steal back the maiden and prevent the world from ending.

You, a band of adventurers has been tasked with breaking in to the [Azure Castle's vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/key-vault) and steal the [master key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/sql-server-and-database-encryption-keys-database-engine?view=sql-server-ver16#database-master-key) required to open the door to the [secure room](https://www.ssh.com/products/secure-workspace) where [Isa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security_awareness) [Dora](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/digital-operational-resilience-act-dora_en) is kept, but watch out so that you don't get discovered by the almighty necromancer as he guards his castle using his favorite spell, [Sauron's eye](https://github.com/vivami/SauronEye). Will you be able to unlock the hidden key, free the maiden and save the world?
In order to win, you will need to use [OWASP Cornucopia](https://owasp.org/www-project-cornucopia/) cards to break into the unbreakable castle. 
If in doubt, throw the dice to unlock the castle's secrets.
