# Cesspit - You successfully land your dragon

You decide to land the dragon on the mountain outcrop. The dragon lands safely on the mountain outcrop. You jump off and walk over the land bridge to the other side. The mountain side is to steep to climb up or down, but you notice a smaller ledge at the side of the land bridge and as you do not have any other option, you climb over the the ledge and enter into what appears to be a secret cave.
You enter the cave which takes you futher and further down into the mountain until you reach a large room with a large cesspit that reeks like a toilet. On the oposite side of the cesspit, filled with excrements and feces, there is iron gate that lies half submerged.
The gate was probably meant for a way of regulating the sewage from the castle.
