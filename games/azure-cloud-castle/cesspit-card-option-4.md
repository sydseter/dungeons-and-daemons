# Cesspit - Authentication - 3

Just before you are about to jump into the cesspit you notice some scriblings on the dungeon wall on the right side of the cesspit, you jump in, swim closer and notice that the numbers 6946251293 are carved into the stone wall, you commit them to memory, swim across to the gate, enter the numbers on the dial. The lock says click, the gate opens and you enter into the lower part of the castle dungeon.

## Note:

Passwords and secrets need protection.
You must never write them down on a post-it, commit them to source code, expose, record, send or store them in unencrypted form. 

You may mistakingly assume that you don't need to protect passwords and secrets due to the fact that they are hidden, inaccessible or in this case, protected by a **stinking** cesspit, but a good hacker always find his way around these type of barriers.
