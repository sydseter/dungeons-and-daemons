# Cesspit - Authentication - 5

You jump into the cesspit holding your nose as you swim towards the gate.
As you reach the gate you enter the combination 1-2-3, 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4-5 on the dial, adding a number and increasing it by one until the lock says click. The gate opens and you enter into the lower part of the castle dungeon.

## Note:

Always use strong passwords/phrases and/or implement multi-factor authentication, especially for accounts with more privileged access. Prevent the use of default, short and/or easily guessable, well-known passwords or number sequences. 

You may mistakingly assume that you don't need strong authentication due to the fact that the functionality is hidden, inaccessible or in this case, protected by a **stinking** cesspit, but a good hacker always find his way around these type of barriers.
