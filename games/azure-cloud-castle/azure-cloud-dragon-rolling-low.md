# Cesspit - You fail to land your dragon

You decide to land the dragon on the mountain outcrop. The dragon lands, but the ground beneath it gives away and the dragon tumbles.
You all fall of the dragon, but manage to hold on to what is left of the mountain outcrop by your teeth, but the dragon flies away and disapears. You notice a smaller ledge at the side of the outcrop and as you do not have any other option, you climb over the the ledge and enter into what appears to be a secret cave.
You enter the cave which takes you futher and further down into the mountain until you reach a large room with a large cesspit that reeks like a toilet. On the oposite side of the cesspit, filled with excrements and feces, there is iron gate that lies half submerged.
The gate was probably meant for a way of regulating the sewage from the castle.
