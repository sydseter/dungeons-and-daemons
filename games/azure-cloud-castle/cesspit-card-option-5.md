# Cesspit - Cornucopia - 3

![A cesspit with an open iron gate.[medium]](/static/images/games/azure-cloud-castle/cesspit-gate-open.jpg)

You jump into the cesspit holding your nose as you swim towards the gate.
As you reach the gate you notice that the numbers on the gate lock are loose and rusted. As you remove the numbers holes appear which makes it possible for you to peek into the locking mechanism and change it's geers and springs. You turn the huge dial while you rearange the gears until you hear a click. The gate opens and you enter into the lower part of the castle dungeon.

## Note:

Protect source code repositories and server-side source-code. Consider anti reverse-engineering techniques. Do not include or minimise logic/secrets within code accessible by users.

You may mistakingly assume that you do not need to protect your client code from reverse-engineering since it's secrets are properly hidden, inaccessible, or in this case, protected by a **stinking** cesspit, but a good hacker always find his way around these type of barriers. If a hacker can tamper with the clients authentication & authorization mechanisms, he may also gain access to functions and data he should not have access to.
