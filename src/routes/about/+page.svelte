    <p>
        OWASP速 Dungeons & Daemons is a collection of open source games for promoting awareness and knowledge about application security and security practices.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main purpose is to provide a collection of fun and exciting security related LRP games that can be run at conferences, chapter meetings or other type of events.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Although the project was inspired by OWASP Cornucopia and Dungeons & Dragons, it does not necessarily use OWASP Cornucopia cards or game rules. 
    </p>
    <p>It is an <a href="https://github.com/sydseter/dungeons-and-daemons/tree/master">open-source project on Github</a> that is part of <a href="https://owasp.org/">OWASP速</a>, The Open Worldwide Application Security Project.

    <h2 id="owasp-dungeons-and-daemons">How to contribute</h2>
    <p>
        Why aren't all games in the game collection are finished?
    </p>
    <p>
        As Dungeons & Daemons is an open-source project, not all games are equally well maintained, this means that we need your help to complete them!
    </p>
    <p>
        Luckily, contributing is easy, but you should keep in mind that no all games may not need contribution. We use labeling on the website to indicate
        whether a game is playable, ready, work-in-progress, in need of maintainence or simply dead (meeaning that we don't support it anymore).
    </p>
    <p>
        This is to help you in selecting a game to play and to help us to get the necessary help where it is needed. The following are the possible states a game can be in and what the different status codes mean.
        We use labels on the main pages for each game communicate these statuses. These are the states and labels we use:
